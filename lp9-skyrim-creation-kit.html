I need some help from experienced modders. I've been trying to create a mod that makes NPC's not attack you in Werewolf Form. I tried editing the Source for the Script "playerwerewolfchangescript.psc" And editing the line that reads, PlayerREF.SetAttackActorOnSight(true) to PlayerREF.SetAttackActorOnSight(false). After changing it to "false" I tried it in my game and changed into a werewolf. But the game freezes after the transformation animation. I can still hear audio but the game freezes. 
## People misplaced, Skyrim Creation Kit üì∑ So I'm modifying a mod called ''Dragonborn Castle'' and I've just finished a gigantic harbour, so I of course add boats/ships and add fishermen and guards and other NPC's.the case is, when I place em in CK they look perfectly fine, on the position I want the to be on, but when I get into Skyrim, almost ALL of them are in the water, having a pool party with the guards. What can I do to fix this issue? Update: Okay so now not only are people falli.

What can I do to fix this issue? Update: Okay so now not only are people falling into the harbour Hi all, I am working on a personal Skyrim SE mod through the l8est and gr8est 64-bit Creation Kit. As a particular mod got more complex, and thus, needed to be organized and formulated for the ideas that I needed to implement, I started opening some other mods on Nexus and learning how other modders structured their mods so that I can learn how to make my personal mods better, like more efficient, organized, workarounds, etc. Because I don't know how to change where the Creation Kit searches. Wanted to shore up my skills by learning an editor. I've seen some job stating that you're required to create something using one of the above when applying for positions like junior quest designer or open world designer so i wanted an educated opinion on which editor is good at what, and which editor to stay away from. Any other advice is also very welcome. Does anyone know how to make a display (Plaque, Rack, and/or Custom) automatically remove an item (Sword, Dragon Claw, Priest Mask, etc.) from inventory and display it? Darkfox127's Unique Display Cases video was really confusing to me and I need some help with doing it without any special scripts if possible.  
I haven't found any useful information. What i have found is that i need to use Bethesda launcher but i haven't found how to use it to except for 64 bit. I would be happy if someone could help me with this problem. Edit( You grant rights to Bethesda/ZeniMax and if they use a mod in a game don't need to credit the mod author(s). )Edit. Form gamezone.com (https://www.gamezone.com/news/bethesda-owns-the-rights-to-your-skyrim-creation-kit-mods/) >The Skyrim Creation Kit EULA reads: > >If You distribute or otherwise make available New Materials Mods , You automatically grant to Bethesda Softworks {Zenimax} the irrevocable, perpetual, royalty free, sublicensable right and license under all applic. I have found a couple of links on the internet but they look old and I am not sure they are from bethesda. Anyone know where to get the newest version of the creation. Title says as much as I know, I of course have tried deleting it, uninstalling it, reinstalling it and so on, and "removing the dll (there is no such dll) but nothing works. Not including mod list ATM, because apparently mods don't matter for the function of the creation 2 for 3 I guess. Last two threads I assume no one had the knowledge for. Let's see if anyone has the knowledge base for this. I'm creating a follower. I want them to use a certain spell on combat start. How is this done or where can I start. Not a custom spell. It's a default vanilla spell. I've tried googling and what not, but haven't found anything specifically relative. Appreciate the feedback. I've downloaded the creation kit to try and port a mod but when I open the Creation Kit and "Open Data" I do not see any of my mods. I use Mod Organizer and the Creation Kit has been installed in my Skyrim directory, when I open "Data" I only have the Skyrim.esm, Update.esm and the DLC's. Am I doing something wrong. I'm pretty sure specially Skyrim Creation Kit when was released and still now days was made purposely unstable to make hard create mods, the developers only would have the original stable and full version of the Creation Kit or had the tweaks make possible to use the Creation Kit as should be. Just think on this, as example imagine teh developers of the game using the Creation Kit and ops!!!. suddenly crash and lost all the work. that have no sense. As always in world people DISCLAIMER: Since this is a problem with the creation kit only and not any mods that could affect something like that, i didnt include a list of my plugins on modwatch. Everytime i start the creation kit it loads and at this moment when it should load all the different main windows inside the ck like "object window", "cell view" and "render window" it just doesnt do anything. The grey background still remains and nothing opens up. And if i want to load the skyrim.esm master I think that I'm going to buy Skyrim for PC and really try to put out some fun content for it. I was curious about how difficult the creation kit is to use for beginners. 
Lately the creation kit wiki has been having issues calling specific pages, either because they're a bad link or the actual page is full on down like this: https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=MoveTo_-_ObjectReference Does anyone one person do upkeep on the wiki or is it a community thing? Either way it needs some updating considering it's a vital modding resource that helps bring new people does it matter which one i use? are mods created by the special edition kit usable in regular skyrim? i'm guessing that regular skyrim kit probably can't be used on the console version of skyrim special edition right? so should i use one over the other? under what circumstances would i do so? thanks in advice for advance. Just for the record, I'm not going to make Skyrim 2 as my first game so no need to point </p>
