I need advice on replacing one of the LED drivers in my light system. The driver that failed is as follows: input 120-240v output 55w (cant find 55w drivers, only 50 and 60) It does not list voltage. Is it safe to assume 12V? The device has 6 of these power sources. Each powers 20 3w LED clusters wired in series. I don't have a multimeter, but I believe the driver is bad for the following 2 reasons. 1) That drivers LED clusters work when plugged into another driver; and 2) When I switch. ¬∑ 660-0312, Mean Well, LED Driver 48V, Power Supply, IP67, 60W, –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –º–æ—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å 60W , –ö–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–æ–≤ 1 , –ü—Ä–æ–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å Three XHP50.2 2A K2 LEDs arrived today, one on a 20mm MCPCB, two on 16mm boards.

I'm trying to control my outdoor LED deck lights with a Sonoff switch. I hooked it all up last weekend, the switch controller worked fine, but switching on and off didn't actually turn my lights on. My lights are powered from a 240V mains through a 60W 24V DC driver. I've interrupted the wires in between the 24V driver and the LED strip. I'm concerned that the output power somehow doesn't support what the lights need?

The most economical way to do this is to re-use the existing in-wall wiring to carry 24 VDC and replace the transformer that is in the closet with the LED driver (which is 60W). The LED driver is Class 2 compliant, cURus rated, and has protections for short-circuit/over-voltage/over-current. I will house it in an exposed junction.

I had enough and just replaced the dimmers with plain switches, but the problem persists, so I know is the drivers that need replacing. I have two 24 VDC 60W drivers. Can anyone recommend a flicker-free driver to replace them with? Thanks Edit: for clarification, these are DC POTS connected to an LED Driver in turn connected to a switch or dimmer.

Hello all, I am new to PV systems, and had a quick question. I currently have a 24VDC Battery connected to an MPPT, 45W LED Driver, and then a 60W 24 VDC LED Light. I am trying to get the light to run at 60W, and ideally be able to connect an 80W LED Light to the system. Are there any recommendations on how to do this? I assume I would need a 24VDC Driver that is rated for \~80W, yet am have trouble finding one. Thank. Hey everyone. I really tried to not create a thread and do my own research before posting but I'm getting lost and need your help.

Greetings from r/hotpeppers my bud bros! I am building some seedling racks with LED strip lighting and I found my way here while researching. I was stoked to find some amazing guides written by u/SuperAngryGuy and /u/bosslines. You guys rock. My racks only need to light the seedlings for 4-6 weeks before they go into the ground. I followed the advice of u/JuanitosPeppers in the r/hotpeppers wiki. I will use 5 meters of 5630 LED strip for each rack. There will be 14 racks total Hola Bucketeers, I want to show you my new build to see what you guys think. https://imgur.com/a/e2Bnj I have a similar 65L bucket which works quite well as I keep the plant inside it small and flower it early, with lots of LST. This one has 2 x 60W Cree COBs with dimmable drivers and a 12V 5A power supply for the bottom fan and LED strips inside. I don't think it needs to run at full power because I'm getting 20k lux at the bottom of it with just a couple of turns on those drivers. I have a curved driveway of about 100 feet. At the end I have 2 lit poles at about 5-10 feet from the curb. The pizza man drove up, gave me the pizza, then drove over one of the poles and left. I'd really just like to have the pole put back up somehow. Since it happened at night, I will get a better look tomorrow to see actual damage. The poles were turned on and have 3 60w equivalent LED light bulbs, and are about 7 feet tall. I had plowed the driveway earlier today, so it was pretty.
